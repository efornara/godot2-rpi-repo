This license refers to the scripts in this repository.

Individual packages are released according to their own license. Once you
install them, you can find it in its usual place:

    /usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright

In particular, a short version of the license of the engine itself is found in
the main virtual package of the repository, godot2:

    /usr/share/doc/godot2/copyright

A more pedantic version of the engine license (including third party software)
can be found in the packages containing the actual binaries (for example
godot2-editor).
