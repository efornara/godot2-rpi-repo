2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create
2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive
set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without
having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a
number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac
OSX, Windows) as well as mobile (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5)
platforms.

Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT
license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users’ games
are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot’s development is
fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to help shape
their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the
Software Freedom Conservancy not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by
Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the project) for
several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several
work-for-hire titles.
